Project NFZ - No Fly Zone

INTRODUCTION

This project is a web application that helps track and report drone pilots who violate the no-fly zone (NFZ) established to protect an endangered bird species nesting in a local lake. The application lists all the pilots who recently violated the NFZ perimeter and persist the pilot information for 10 minutes since their drone was last seen by the equipment. The application also displays the closest confirmed distance to the nest and contains the pilot’s name, email address, and phone number. It immediately shows the information from the last 10 minutes to anyone opening the application and does not require the user to manually refresh the view to see up-to-date information.

TECHNOLOGIES

This project uses the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.
